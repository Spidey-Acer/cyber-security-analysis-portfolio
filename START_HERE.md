## 🎯 Why This Order?

### Start with Activity 2 (35% grade)
- **Easiest:** Complete template, just execute cells
- **Quick win:** Can finish in 8-12 hours
- **Confidence boost:** Get 35% secured fast
- **Requirement:** Must achieve >90% accuracy

### Then Activity 1 (20% grade)
- **Moderate:** Q1-Q9 straightforward, Q10 needs thinking
- **Q10 is crucial:** 8 marks (40% of Activity 1!)
- **5-stage process:** Prompts guide you through analysis
- **Build momentum:** Another quick completion

### Finally Activity 3 (45% grade)
- **Hardest BUT highest value!**
- **Most time-intensive:** Infrastructure + attacks + report
- **Cannot rush:** Need quality screenshots and documentation
- **Worth the effort:** Nearly half your grade

---

## ⚠️ Critical Success Factors

### ✅ DO:
1. **Start immediately** - Time is your constraint
2. **Follow prompts sequentially** - They build on each other
3. **Document as you go** - Don't save for the end
4. **Track progress daily** - Use PROGRESS_TRACKER.md
5. **Take screenshots during attacks** - Can't recreate later
6. **Ask for help when stuck** - Use the troubleshooting prompts
7. **Back up your work** - Regularly save and backup
8. **Submit something** - Partial credit better than zero

### ❌ DON'T:
1. **Don't skip Activity 3** - It's 45% of your grade!
2. **Don't try to be perfect** - Good enough is better than incomplete
3. **Don't work on all 3 simultaneously** - Finish one, then move on
4. **Don't ignore the prompts** - They're designed to guide you
5. **Don't skip documentation** - You'll need it for reports
6. **Don't leave submission prep to last day** - Things go wrong
7. **Don't ignore word limits** - Activity 3 must be ≤1500 words
8. **Don't forget student ID** - Must be in all three files

## 🆘 What If I'm Stuck?

### Common Situations & Solutions:

**"I don't know what to do next"**
→ Open `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, find your current phase/task, use that prompt

**"Something's not working"**
→ Copy the "I'm Stuck" prompt from `QUICK_START_GUIDE.md` and describe your issue

**"I'm running out of time"**
→ Use the "Time Crisis" prompt to create emergency completion plan

**"Is this good enough to submit?"**
→ Use the "Final Success Check" prompt for honest assessment

**"I'm overwhelmed"**
→ Just do the NEXT SINGLE TASK. Don't think about everything. One step at a time.
