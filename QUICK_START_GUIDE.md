3. Recommend the fastest fix
4. Decide if I should skip and move on

Be direct and time-conscious.
```

### "Running Out of Time" Prompt
```
CRISIS MODE: [X] days until deadline.

Current status:
- Activity 1: [%]
- Activity 2: [%]
- Activity 3: [%]

Create emergency plan:
1. What MUST be finished (for pass grade)
2. What can be minimal (just enough)
3. What to potentially cut
4. Realistic grade target given time

Prioritize passing over perfection!
```

### "Is This Good Enough?" Prompt
```
Review my [Activity 1/2/3] and tell me:
1. Is it submission-ready? (Honest assessment)
2. What's the estimated grade?
3. What are critical gaps?
4. What 1-2 things would improve it most?
5. Should I submit as-is or spend more time?

Be brutally honest. I need realistic feedback.

## 💡 Pro Tips for Speed

### Activity 2 Speed Tips:
- Let the code run while you work on documentation
- SHAP can be slow - use small sample (100 points)
- If struggling with 90% accuracy, try combining features
- Don't overthink conclusions - use actual results

### Activity 1 Speed Tips:
- Q1-Q8 are straightforward - don't overthink
- For Q10, focus on TOP suspicious IPs (3-5, not all)
- Use the analysis code provided - it's complete
- Screenshot as you go - don't redo later

### Activity 3 Speed Tips:
- **Use GoibhniUWE** if available - fastest setup
- Do 2-3 attacks WELL rather than 5 attacks poorly
- Take screenshots DURING attacks - can't recreate later
- Write report sections as you go - don't save for end
- Use provided command references - don't research from scratch
- Focus on clear evidence over complex attacks
