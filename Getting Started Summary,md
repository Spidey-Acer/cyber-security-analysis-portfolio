## 🆘 Common Issues

### "My log file is too large for Pandas"
```python
# Solution 1: Read in chunks
chunks = []
for chunk in pd.read_csv(file, delim_whitespace=True, chunksize=10000):
    chunks.append(chunk)
data = pd.concat(chunks)

# Solution 2: Use specific columns only
data = pd.read_csv(file, delim_whitespace=True, 
                   usecols=['c-ip', 'datetime', 'sc-status'])
```

### "Jupyter kernel keeps dying"
- Increase available RAM
- Process data in smaller batches
- Use `n_jobs=1` in sklearn models
- Close other applications

### "Can't achieve 90% accuracy in Activity 2"
- Try more advanced feature engineering
- Tune model hyperparameters
- Use cross-validation
- Combine both feature approaches
- Increase max_features in TfidfVectorizer

### "Don't have access to VMs for Activity 3"
- Use university lab computers (32GB RAM)
- Book a lab room for extended time
- Start early to avoid resource issues
- Consider GoibhniUWE (simplest option)

---

## 💡 Tips for Excellence (70%+)

### Activity 1
- Demonstrate creative data exploration beyond basic questions

- Perform attack chains (multi-stage attacks)
- Create custom SIEM detection rules
- Correlate multiple log sources
- Link to MITRE ATT&CK framework
- Professional report with clear narrative
