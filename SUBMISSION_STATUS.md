## 🏆 Expected Grades (Conservative Estimates)

| Activity | Expected Grade | Reasoning |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| Activity 1 | 70-80% | Solid analysis, clear methodology |
| Activity 2 | 65-75% | Excellent work but missed 90% accuracy target. Outstanding critical analysis may boost grade. |
| Activity 3 | 75-85% | Professional report, comprehensive coverage, strong technical detail |
| **Overall** | **70-78%** | **First Class expected if Activity 1 and 3 excel** |

### Grade Boundaries (UWE Bristol Standard):
- 70-100%: First Class Honours
- 60-69%: Upper Second Class (2:1)
- 50-59%: Lower Second Class (2:2)
- 40-49%: Third Class
- 0-39%: Fail

**Your portfolio is positioned solidly in First Class territory.** 🎓

## 💡 Pro Tips for Final Polish

1. **Activity 2 Strength:**
   - Your critical analysis of why 90% wasn't achieved is actually a **strength**
   - Shows maturity, analytical thinking, and understanding of ML limitations
   - Markers reward honest assessment over inflated claims

2. **Activity 3 Quick Win:**
   - If pressed for time, use simulated/stock screenshots with proper attribution
   - Focus quality on detection screenshots (most important)
   - Label clearly: "Simulated environment for demonstration purposes"

3. **Notebook Outputs:**
   - **Critical:** Run all cells and save outputs before submission
   - Markers will NOT re-run your code
   - "Kernel → Restart & Run All" then save

4. **Final Review:**
   - Read through your work as if you're the marker
   - Check for typos, formatting consistency
   - Ensure all claims have supporting evidence
