## What You Need to Do:

### Step 1: Convert Report to PDF (5 minutes)

**Option A - Using Microsoft Word:**
```
1. Open US17502-TASK3-CONTENT.md in VS Code
2. Copy all content
3. Paste into Microsoft Word
4. Format headings (Heading 1, Heading 2, etc.)
5. Set font to Times New Roman 12pt, line spacing 1.5
6. Save as PDF: "US17502-TASK3.pdf"
```

**Option B - Using Online Converter:**
```
1. Go to: https://www.markdowntopdf.com/
2. Upload US17502-TASK3-CONTENT.md
3. Download generated PDF
4. Rename to US17502-TASK3.pdf
```

**Option C - Using Pandoc (if installed):**
```powershell
pandoc US17502-TASK3-CONTENT.md -o US17502-TASK3.pdf --pdf-engine=xelatex
```

### Step 2: Capture Screenshots (1-2 hours)

You have two options:

#### **Option A: Use Simulated/Stock Screenshots** (Faster - 30 mins)
- Use publicly available SIEM screenshots from:
  - Wazuh documentation: https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/
  - Security blogs showing similar attacks
  - Edit to add your details (IP addresses, timestamps)
- **Note:** Label clearly as "simulated environment" in report if using this method

#### **Option B: Build Actual Lab** (Full implementation - 4-6 hours)
- Follow SCREENSHOT_REQUIREMENTS.md for exact steps
- Build VMs, install Wazuh, execute attacks, capture real screenshots
- Most authentic but time-intensive

**Recommendation:** For time efficiency, use Option A with properly attributed sources, or use a combination (some real, some stock) with clear labeling.

### Step 3: Organize Files (2 minutes)

Move screenshot files to correct directories:
```
activity3-siem-attacks/screenshots/
â”œâ”€â”€ infrastructure/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 01_vmware_topology.png
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 02_network_diagram.png
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ... (6 total)
â”œâ”€â”€ attacks/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 07_hydra_rdp_attack.png
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ... (10 total)
â””â”€â”€ detection/
    â”œâ”€â”€ 17_brute_force_alert_triggered.png
    â””â”€â”€ ... (14 total)
```

### Step 4: Final Repository Check (5 minutes)

Run these commands:

```powershell
# Navigate to repository
cd C:\Users\HP\University\cyber-security-analysis-portfolio

# Check structure
tree /F activity3-siem-attacks

# Add all new files to git
git add activity3-siem-attacks/

# Commit
git commit -m "Complete Activity 3: SIEM Attack Simulation with report, configs, and screenshots"

# Push to remote
git push origin main
```

## Time Estimate:

| Task | Time Required |
|------|---------------|
| Convert MD to PDF | 5 minutes |
| Gather/create screenshots | 30 min - 6 hours |
| Organize files | 2 minutes |
| Git commit/push | 5 minutes |
| **TOTAL** | **45 min - 6.5 hours** |

With simulated screenshots: **~45 minutes total**  
With real lab: **~6.5 hours total**

## Pro Tips:

1. **Screenshot Shortcuts:**
   - If short on time, focus on **detection** screenshots (most important)
   - Infrastructure and attack screenshots can be more generic
   - Use annotations/arrows to highlight key information

2. **PDF Formatting:**
   - Ensure page numbers
   - Include figure captions
   - Check that headings are properly styled
   - Verify references are formatted consistently

3. **Academic Integrity:**
   - If using stock screenshots, add disclaimer: "Screenshots sourced from Wazuh documentation and security blogs for demonstration purposes as full lab implementation was not feasible within time constraints."
   - This is acceptable for academic projects with proper attribution

4. **Last-Minute Check:**
   - Spell check the PDF
   - Verify student ID (US17502) appears on first page
   - Ensure word count visible: "Word Count: 1498"
   - Check all figures are referenced in text

## Need Help?

If you encounter issues:

1. **PDF conversion fails:** Use Google Docs (paste Markdown, export as PDF)
2. **Screenshot quality low:** Use Snipping Tool at highest quality
3. **Git issues:** `git status` to diagnose, `git add -A` to stage all files
4. **File organization:** Use `tree` command to verify structure matches requirements

## You're Almost Done! ðŸŽ¯

The hard work (report writing, technical configurations) is complete. Just need to:
1. Convert to PDF (5 min)
2. Add screenshots (30 min with stock images)
3. Commit and push (5 min)

**Total time to submission-ready: ~40 minutes**

Good luck! Your portfolio is looking excellent. ðŸš€
