Task specification
What am I required to do on this assessment?

You will complete a portfolio of work that comprises of three core questions. The questions are available to view via Gitlab from Week 2 of the module: https://gitlab.uwe.ac.uk/pa-legg/csa2024.

Whilst all materials will be made available from Week 2, the tasks themselves will be introduced and discussed gradually over the course of the module, in weeks 2, 4 and 6 respectively. This will help you to manage your time for completing each worksheet in line with the module delivery. Please make use of the non-assessed lab exercises to help further your knowledge, to then enable you to complete the tasks.

The three tasks (along with available marks per question) are as follows:

●	Activity 1 (Week 2 discussion): Investigate a web server application logs to identify malicious attack activity using Python data science libraries (20 marks available)

●	Activity 2 (Week 4 discussion): Conduct an investigation on a URL database to develop a DGA classification system using machine learning techniques (35 marks available)

●	Activity 3 (Week 6 discussion): Conduct a practical research study using a virtualised infrastructure to simulate attacks and identify these through a SIEM platform (45 marks available)

 
Completing your assessment 

Where should I start?
Ensure that you have a grasp of the lecture materials, and the supporting non-assessed materials. The non-assessed exercises will help develop your Python skills, including your ability to work with data within the associated tools and libraries, that will then benefit your ability to pursue the assessed worksheets.

What do I need to do to pass? 
You will need to achieve 50% across the complete portfolio submission. The details above show the total possible marks available for each worksheet. Note that you do not necessarily need to achieve 50% on each portfolio, as the overall grade will be the combination across the three worksheets as submitted.

How do I achieve high marks in this assessment? 
You will need to demonstrate high competency across all three worksheets. Note that the worksheets cover a variety of learning styles – some have directed questions, some are more unguided and require you to demonstrate creativity and exploration, and some will require you to report your findings through professional writing.

How does the learning and teaching relate to the assessment? 
The three worksheets relate to various aspects of data analytics in cyber security, ranging from the analysis of web server access logs, malware-related URL generation, and finally the curation of a virtual environment for conducting an attack and generating the associated activity logs. The assessment is designed to cover a variety of topics, of which build upon the topics covered in your lectures and in your unassessed lab work, and help you to demonstrate your mastery of the subject area and skills covered in the module, and as discovered through your extended research.

What additional resources may help me complete this assessment?
●	Beyond your scheduled teaching, a key skill will be your ability to research and explore online documentation, to understand functions and features of Python data science libraries as covered in worksheets 1 and 2. Furthermore, your ability to research and explore CVEs and possible attack vectors will prove crucial in the final worksheet activity.
